# 1 Listen Carefully
#   Ask questions, they will leave out information so you can narrow scope

# 2 Draw up/walk through an example

# 3 State how to do it with brute force
# State Big-O of brute force

# Optimize
#   Think of data structures, familiar algorithms,

# Walk through your proposed algorithm, link of edge cases you might want to address

# Error checks, talk about what you'd like to test if you don't have time, add todos'
# Variable names should be clear
# What methods can you assume you have written elsewhere vs what they want to see you write
# Conceptual test -- walkthrough line by line
# Look at problem areas: base case in recursion, integer division, null nodes, start of iteration in LL
# Small test case walkthrough
# Special test case walkthrough
